                    Sawadee is a Thai greeting. Sawadee Kha is the polite way to
                    say “Hello” or “Welcome” for females. “Kha” is usually used
                    by a girl at the end of the sentence.

                    At Absolute Thai, we serve good food with hospitality with a
                    heart.

                <p class="sawadee__text">
                    Our mission seems easy enough; only it is not. Because Thai
                    food is anything but simple, it is an art to symphonize the
                    different ingredients to create a masterpiece that
                    ultimately becomes a beautiful serenade to the diner’s taste
                    buds.
                </p>
                <p class="sawadee__text">
                    The legacy of Thai food is important to us too. As a
                    beautiful fusion that is centuries old, we try our best to
                    preserve its sanctity. To quote our founder, the late Mr.
                    Thanee Laivarintr, “Thai food is already fusion food - it’s
                    a mixture of Indian, Malay and Chinese cuisines. If we were
                    to add another cuisine in the mix, it wouldn’t be fusion
                    anymore; it would be confusion.” Of course, the whole
                    experience is held together by the famed Thai hospitality, a
                    genuine gesture that comes from the heart.

                    Education, race, nationality, the experience is never an
                    issue when it comes to joining the Absolute Thai family.
                    School janitor, taxi driver, dancer, hawker, odd-job
                    workers. These are just some of the occupations held by our
                    staff and chefs before they rose through the ranks in
                    Absolute Thai.

                    The only qualification that matters is the heart to bring
                    the best to the dining table. We are what we are today
                    because of a few simple values that we practice. Respect,
                    for instance, is earned and not demanded in our
                    organization. Leaders of their respective teams are expected
                    to lead by example and carry themselves with integrity.

                        work and communicate with each other like a family. This
                        is important for the growth of their outlet, and to an

                        own home. This infectious positivity has made Absolute
